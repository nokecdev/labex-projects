Redis Data Structures Overview
Strings:

Strings are the simplest data type in Redis. They can hold any data, such as text or binary data, up to 512 MB.
Example:
SET mykey "Hello, Redis!"
GET mykey
Here, SET stores the string "Hello, Redis!" under the key mykey, and GET retrieves it.
Lists:

Lists are collections of ordered strings. You can add elements to the head or tail of the list.
Example:
LPUSH mylist "first"
LPUSH mylist "second"
LRANGE mylist 0 -1
This adds "second" and "first" to mylist, and LRANGE retrieves all elements from the list.
Sets:

Sets are unordered collections of unique strings. They are useful for storing non-duplicate items.
Example:
SADD myset "apple"
SADD myset "banana"
SMEMBERS myset
SADD adds items to myset, and SMEMBERS retrieves all unique members.
Hashes:

Hashes are maps between string field and string values, ideal for representing objects.
Example:
HSET user:1000 name "John Doe"
HGET user:1000 name
This stores the name "John Doe" under the hash user:1000, and HGET retrieves it.
Why Use Redis?
Redis is an in-memory data structure store, which means it is extremely fast for read and write operations. It is often used for caching, session management, and real-time analytics due to its speed and versatility.
